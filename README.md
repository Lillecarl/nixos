# LilleCarl nix configuration
This configuration manages my personal desktop and 2 work laptops, one being a Mac so it's mostly just packages since MacOS isn't designed to be pure.

I don't use home-manager since I want my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Lillecarl/chezmoi) to be usable on non nix installed systems. [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) is doing a fine job with my dotfiles.
